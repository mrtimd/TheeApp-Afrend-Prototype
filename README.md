TheeApp-Afrend-Prototype
This is a proof-of-concept for Thee App, a single sign-on (SSO) AI hub powering MDRMSâ€”a reimagined MSNBC as an AI trade school and media platform. Built by Media Dreams LLC, it ties into a broader vision: a gamified STEM education system and Prometheus ID for secure identity management.
